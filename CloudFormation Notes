CloudFormation Notes
====================

CloudFormation can't create a new Route 53 DNS zone for you, you'll need to create one manually.

Can't create Route 53 DNS record sets if the record already exists.

CloudFront distributions and Route 53 record sets take a while to create and to modify. If the resource isn't being modified during an update it is fast.

You can't actually create a lambda function through CloudFormation at this time.

If an update fails and rolls back it may leave orphan buckets if they have `"DeletionPolicy" : "Retain"`
